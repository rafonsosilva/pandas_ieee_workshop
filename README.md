# Applied Data Science with pandas

This is a learning material developed using Jupyter Notebook to support a <a href="https://www.ieeetoronto.ca/2020/08/06/applied-data-science-with-pandas/" target="_blank">webinar hosted by the IEEE Toronto about pandas library</a>.  

To run the material, download or clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook in the same folder where you downloaded/extracted the files.  
Then, execute the file main.ipynb from the Jupyter Notebook.
