    "Some of the reasons for that pandas has been widely used are:\n",
    "- It's open source and its use is free of charge for everyone \n",
    "- It offers tons of functionalities\n",
    "- It's well-supported by the community\n",
    "- It's under active development\n",
    "- There are lots of documentation, tutorials and Q&A's available on internet\n",
    "- It plays well with other packages: e.g. It is built on top of NumPy (Numerical Python), and works well with scikit-learn\n",
